AMREF SMS Consent – Internal Employee Alerts

Employees may opt in to receive operational and incident-related SMS alerts from AMREF.

Verbal Consent Process:
During onboarding or incident-response setup, employees are verbally informed and asked for consent using the following script:

"You agree to receive operational and incident-related SMS messages from AMREF.
Message frequency is limited to urgent operational alerts only.
Message and data rates may apply.
Reply STOP at any time to opt out, or HELP for assistance.
Consent is not a condition of employment."

Consent is recorded internally.
Employees may opt out at any time by replying STOP.
These messages are strictly non-marketing and for internal operational use only.
